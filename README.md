# NNI_MATLAB
Natural Neighbor Interpolation in MATLAB

This is an implementation of Natural Neighbor Interpolation of multivariate functions of planar coordinates in MATLAB.  Output not only includes interpolated function values (which is also implemented by MATLAB's built-in 'scatteredInterpolant'), but 'analytic' interpolant derivatives, which can be used, for instance, as inputs to gradient-based optimization methods.

Includes an implementation of boths Sibson's and Farin's $C^1$ interpolation methods.
